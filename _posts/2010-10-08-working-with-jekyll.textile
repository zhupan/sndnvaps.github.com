excerpt: |-

 p. Been working with "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll for a little bit now and I wanted to post something up on this blog as a place holder for my tech site up on "GitHub.com":http://github.com. This article uses Textile markup and is then translated through the Jekyll framework into a static HTML page.

h3. this is a heading

p. This is some content for the post. This is just a test to check things out.

p. Here is some ruby

{% highlight ruby linenos=table %}
# comment
require 'foobar/test'

class Test
  def method
    @test = User.find(params[:id])
    :string => "#{this is a string} inside another string."
    return this
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
<br />

p. *NOTE:* [-I don't know if I like the Pygment highlight feature of Jekyll. It lacks the ability to cleanly capture the source code from the code block. Looking into other options.-][+Thanks to Matthias for the great info on getting the line numbers to be seperate from the code block for copying. Does anyone have a link(s) for Pygment that better explains its features?+]

p. My "syntax.css":http://media.jlwestsr.com/css/syntax.css file. (To download Right-Click the link and do a "Save As")

h3. Nice To Haves

# Auto-generated sitemap.xml
# Ability to have the site switch layouts depending on the useragent that is being used for viewing the website. (Desktop Browser, Mobile Browser, etc.)
