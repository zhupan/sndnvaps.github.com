excerpt: |-

 p. Been working with "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll for a little bit now and I wanted to post something up on this blog as a place holder for my tech site up on "GitHub.com":http://github.com. This article uses Textile markup and is then translated through the Jekyll framework into a static HTML page.

h3. this is a heading

p. This is some content for the post. This is just a test to check things out.

p. Here is some ruby

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
# comment
require 'foobar/test'

class Test
  def method
    @test = User.find(params[:id])
    :string => "#{this is a string} inside another string."
    return this
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

p. *NOTE:* I don't know if I like the Pygment highlight feature of Jekyll. It lacks the ability to cleanly cature the source code form the code block for pasting somewhere else. Looking into other options. 

My "syntax.css":http://media.jlwestsr.com/css/syntax.css file. (To download Right-Click the link and do a "Save As")

h3. Nice To Haves

# Auto-generated sitemap.xml
# Ability to have the site switch layouts depending on the useragent that is being used for viewing the website. (Desktop Browser, Mobile Browser, etc.)
