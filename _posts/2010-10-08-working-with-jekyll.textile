title: "Working with Jekyll"
excerpt: |-

 p. Been working with "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll for a little bit now and I wanted to post something up on this blog as a place holder for my tech site up on "GitHub.com":http://github.com. This article uses Textile markup and is then translated through the Jekyll framework into a static HTML page.

h3. this is a heading

p. This is some content for the post. This is just a test to check things out.

p. Here is some ruby

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
# comment
require 'foobar/test'

class Test
  def method
    @test = User.find(params[:id])
    :string => "#{this is a string} inside another string."
    return this
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

&nbsp; 

p. *NOTE:* I don't know if I like the Pygment highlight feature of Jekyll. It lacks the ability to cleanly cature the source code form the code block for pasting somewhere else. Looking into other options.
