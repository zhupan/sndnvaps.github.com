This is some content for the post. This is just a test to check things out.

Here is some ruby

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
# comment
require 'foobar/test'

class Test
  def method
    @test = User.find(params[:id])
    :string => "#{this is a string} inside another string."
    return this
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
