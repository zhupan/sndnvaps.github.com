### Fixing a Bad Layout

So one of the reasons that it has taken me so long for a new post is that I 
found that the layout breaks pretty bad in IE6 and I was wanting to make some 
drastic changes to it utilizing HTML5. So with that said just know that I am 
currently working on a new layout that will be here soon.

I have also have a lot of drafts started that I want to complete and the 
following are just some taste of things to come.

* Creating a Ruby on Rails app with a specific version of the Rails gem
* Using Python 2 or Python 3
* Review of Dragondisk with Amazon Web Services S3 Account
* Building a Basic HTML5/CSS3 Layout
* Working with Amazon Web Services for Beginners
* Working with Amazon Web Services EC2
* Working with Amazon Web Services S3
* Building a LAMP server with Amazon Web Services EC2 and S3

This is just a small taste of things to come. I have been doing a lot of 
research with the Amazon Web Services and look forward to sharing what I have 
learned over the past couple of years. Most of the servers that I work with has 
been Ubuntu 10.* and have been successful in setting up a rehost company 
utilizing the Amazon services.

And in closing I will also like to share my experiences with open source 
platforms that I am working with on a daily basis. For one thing I now do all 
my software development and administration from a laptop utilizing Ubuntu 10.10 
Desktop. I could be more satisfied with the results so far.

God Bless
