## sndnvaps.github.com (ver 0.1.1)

This site has gone through a complete redesign of using the jekyll-bootstrap 
github.com project.

## Content

In adition to hosting my [Tech Blog](http://y.ipy.cc/) this site also 
hosts serveral sections that you may find useful:

## [Cheatsheets](http://y.ipy.cc/cheatsheets/)

This area has many different types of cheatsheets. You can find cheatsheets 
for different programming languages as well as operating system cheatsheets.

## [Cookbooks](http://y.ipy.cc/cookbooks/)

The cookbooks area has something for everything. As I come accross different use
cases that seem out of the ordinary I will be documenting the process of solving
 the requirement in this area no matter what language or operating system.


## Versioning of Source Code

This application uses the [Open ACS versioning system](http://openacs.org/doc/eng-standards-versioning.html)
