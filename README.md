## jlwestsr.github.com (ver 0.1.0)

This site has gone through a complete redesign of using the jekyll-bootstrap 
github.com project.

## Content

In adition to hosting my [Tech Blog](http://jlwestrs.com/) this site also 
hosts serveral sections that you may find useful:

## [Cheatsheets](http://jlwestsr.com/cheatsheets/)

This area has many different types of cheatsheets. You can find cheatsheets 
for different programming languages as well as operating system cheatsheets.

## [Cookbooks](http://jlwestsr.com/cookbooks/)

The cookbooks area has something for everything. As I come accross different use
cases that seem out of the ordinary I will be documenting the process of solving
 the requirement in this area no matter what language or operating system.

## For my son...

This site is dedicated to my son, Jason L West Jr., in the hopes that he will find
this information useful as he continues his journey into the realm of programming 
and the IT industry.
