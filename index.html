<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>This is the home page for my tech blog. I am working on wrapping up with a conversion of this site with a new layout using the the <a href="/2012/04/29/theme-conversion-with-jekyll-bootstrap.html">Jekyll-Bootstrap</a> framework. This site is a work in progress and I welcome any feed back that you have to offer where I allow comments.</p>

<p>I will be modifying this home page as I fill in content with the rest of the site. This site is dedicated to my son, Jason L West Jr., who has showed a great interest in what I do for a living and will be assisting me this summer with projects while he is on his summer break.</p>

<strong>TODO:</strong>
